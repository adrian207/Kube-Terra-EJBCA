## Evaluation Framework

### Scoring Methodology

**Scale**: 1-5 points per criterion
- **5**: Excellent - Exceeds requirements significantly
- **4**: Good - Meets requirements with some advantages
- **3**: Satisfactory - Meets basic requirements
- **2**: Poor - Partially meets requirements
- **1**: Unacceptable - Does not meet requirements

**Weighted Scoring**:
- **Critical Criteria**: Weight × 2
- **Important Criteria**: Weight × 1.5
- **Standard Criteria**: Weight × 1

**Total Score Calculation**:
```
Total Score = Σ(Criterion Score × Weight × Importance Multiplier)
Maximum Possible Score = Σ(Max Criterion Score × Weight × Importance Multiplier)
Percentage = (Total Score / Maximum Possible Score) × 100
```

### Decision Thresholds

| Score Range | Recommendation | Action |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| **90-100%** | Strongly Recommended | Proceed with procurement |
| **80-89%** | Recommended | Proceed with minor concerns |
| **70-79%** | Acceptable | Proceed with mitigation plans |
| **60-69%** | Marginal | Require significant improvements |
