## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive migration strategy for transitioning from legacy, manual certificate management processes to an automated, policy-driven PKI platform using Keyfactor Command. The migration addresses current pain points including certificate-related outages, manual operational overhead, and compliance gaps.

**Migration Goals**:
- Eliminate certificate-related outages (12/year → <1/year)
- Reduce manual effort by 90% (120 hours/month → <10 hours/month)
- Achieve 95%+ automated renewal rate
- Implement comprehensive certificate visibility and control
- Meet compliance requirements (SOC 2, PCI-DSS, ISO 27001)

**Timeline**: 24 weeks (6 months) to full implementation
**Approach**: Phased migration with parallel operations during transition

## Current State Analysis

### Legacy Environment Assessment

**Current Certificate Management**:
- **Manual Processes**: Certificate requests via email, manual CSR generation, manual installation
- **Multiple CAs**: AD CS for internal, various public CAs for external
- **No Centralized Inventory**: Certificates scattered across systems
- **Manual Renewals**: Spreadsheet tracking, manual renewal processes
- **Limited Automation**: Basic scripts for some renewals
- **Compliance Gaps**: No centralized audit trail, limited reporting

**Pain Points Identified**:
1. **Certificate Outages**: 12 production outages per year due to expired certificates
2. **Manual Effort**: 120 hours/month spent on certificate operations
3. **Time to Issue**: 2-5 days for standard certificate requests
4. **Visibility**: ~60% of certificates are visible and managed
5. **Compliance**: Unable to demonstrate certificate inventory or controls
6. **Security**: Weak keys (1024-bit), certificates for departed employees
7. **Cost**: High operational costs, potential compliance penalties

**Certificate Inventory** (Estimated):
- **Total Certificates**: ~2,500 certificates across environment
- **Internal Certificates**: ~1,800 (AD CS issued)
- **External Certificates**: ~700 (various public CAs)
- **Expiring Soon**: ~150 certificates expiring in next 90 days
- **Unmanaged**: ~1,000 certificates with unknown ownership

### Risk Assessment

**High-Risk Areas**:
- **Critical Production Systems**: Web servers, load balancers, databases
- **External-Facing Services**: Public websites, APIs, customer portals
- **Compliance-Critical Systems**: Payment processing, healthcare, financial
- **Legacy Systems**: Older applications with manual certificate management

**Medium-Risk Areas**:
- **Internal Applications**: Intranet sites, internal APIs
- **Development/Testing**: Non-production environments
- **Infrastructure Components**: Network devices, monitoring systems

**Low-Risk Areas**:
- **Personal Certificates**: Individual user certificates
- **Test Certificates**: Development and testing certificates
- **Non-Critical Systems**: Internal tools and utilities
