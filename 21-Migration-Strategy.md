## 1. Current State Assessment

### 1.1 Current Certificate Landscape

**Inventory**:
- Total certificates: ~2,500
  - Windows servers: ~1,000 (40%)
  - Linux servers: ~600 (24%)
  - Cloud services (Azure/AWS): ~400 (16%)
  - Kubernetes workloads: ~300 (12%)
  - Network devices: ~150 (6%)
  - Other: ~50 (2%)

**Current Management Processes**:
| Process | Current Method | Pain Points | Automation Level |
|---------|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Certificate Request** | Email PKI team | Manual, slow (2-5 days) | 0% |
| **Approval** | Email approval chain | Inconsistent, no audit trail | 0% |
| **Issuance** | Manual CSR‚ÜíCA | Error-prone, time-consuming | 10% (AD CS only) |
| **Deployment** | Manual copy/paste | Mistakes common, downtime risk | 5% (GPO for Windows) |
| **Renewal** | Email reminders | Often missed, frequent outages | 5% (AD CS auto-renew) |
| **Revocation** | Manual request | Slow, inconsistent | 0% |
| **Inventory** | Spreadsheets | Out of date, incomplete | 0% |

**Current Tools**:
- Certificate Authority: Microsoft AD CS (2 issuing CAs)
- Inventory: Excel spreadsheets (last updated 6 months ago)
- Monitoring: Manual review of expiry dates
- Deployment: Manual (scp, RDP, copy-paste)

### 1.2 Challenges to Address

**Operational Challenges**:
- üìä **No visibility**: ~40% of certificates not in inventory
- ‚è∞ **Manual renewal**: 12 cert-related outages/year
- üïê **Slow issuance**: 2-5 day turnaround time
- üë• **No automation**: 120 hours/month of manual effort
- üîí **Shadow IT**: Unknown number of unauthorized certificates
- üìâ **No compliance reporting**: Manual audit preparation (weeks)

**Technical Debt**:
- Weak keys still in use (RSA 1024, MD5 signatures)
- Expired certificates still deployed (~50)
- Self-signed certificates in production (~30)
- Wildcard certificates overused (security risk)
- No certificate pinning or validation

---

## 2. Migration Principles

### 2.1 Core Principles

**1. Zero-Downtime Migration**
- No production service interruptions during migration
- Parallel operation of old and new systems during transition
- Gradual cutover per application/service

**2. Risk-Based Prioritization**
- Start with low-risk, high-value applications
- Build confidence before migrating critical systems
- Pilot in dev/test before production

**3. Automation First**
- Every migrated certificate must use automated enrollment
- Manual processes only for exceptional cases
- Document and automate migration procedures

**4. Reversibility**
- Maintain ability to roll back to old process
- Keep old certificates active until new ones proven
- Clear rollback criteria and procedures

**5. Knowledge Transfer**
- Train team before migration
- Document procedures and lessons learned
- Build internal expertise gradually

### 2.2 Success Criteria

**Phase-Based Goals**:
- **Phase 1** (Discovery): 95%+ of certificates discovered and inventoried
- **Phase 2** (Pilot): 5 applications migrated successfully, zero incidents
- **Phase 3** (Rollout): 50% of certificates under Keyfactor management
- **Phase 4** (Completion): 95%+ automation rate, < 1 outage/year

## 4. Certificate Migration Approach

### 4.1 Migration Strategies

**Strategy 1: Parallel Deployment (Recommended)**
```
1. Request new certificate via Keyfactor
2. Deploy new certificate alongside old (different port or host if needed)
3. Test new certificate (limited traffic)
4. Cutover traffic to new certificate
5. Monitor for stability period (1-7 days)
6. Revoke old certificate
```

**Pros**: Zero downtime, easy rollback
**Cons**: Requires dual configuration temporarily

---

**Strategy 2: Direct Replacement**
```
1. Request new certificate via Keyfactor
2. Schedule maintenance window
3. Replace old certificate with new
4. Restart service
5. Validate
```

**Pros**: Simple, fast
**Cons**: Requires maintenance window, higher risk

---

**Strategy 3: Blue-Green Deployment** (for critical services)
```
1. Stand up new environment (green) with Keyfactor-issued cert
2. Test green environment
3. Cutover traffic to green
4. Monitor
5. Decommission old environment (blue)
```

**Pros**: Safest, easy rollback
**Cons**: Requires duplicate infrastructure

### 4.2 Pre-Migration Checklist

## 5. Application Migration Patterns

### 5.1 Pattern: Windows IIS Web Server

**Current**: Manual PFX upload, manual renewal
**Target**: Keyfactor orchestrator auto-deployment

**Migration Steps**:
```powershell
# 1. Deploy Keyfactor orchestrator (if not present)
# 2. Register IIS server as certificate store in Keyfactor
# 3. Request certificate via Keyfactor
# 4. Orchestrator automatically deploys to IIS
# 5. Verify binding

# Verification
Get-WebBinding -Name "Default Web Site" -Protocol https
```

**Auto-Renewal**: ‚úÖ Automatic via orchestrator

---

### 5.2 Pattern: NGINX on Linux

**Current**: Manual certbot with Let's Encrypt
**Target**: ACME with Keyfactor

**Migration Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Update ACME server configuration
export ACME_SERVER="https://keyfactor.contoso.com/acme"

# 2. Request new certificate
sudo certbot certonly \
  --standalone \
  --server $ACME_SERVER \
  -d webapp.contoso.com

# 3. Update NGINX configuration
sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
# ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/webapp.contoso.com/fullchain.pem;
# ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/webapp.contoso.com/privkey.pem;

# 4. Test and reload
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx

# 5. Verify
openssl s_client -connect webapp.contoso.com:443 -servername webapp.contoso.com
```

**Auto-Renewal**: ‚úÖ Automatic via certbot timer

---

### 5.3 Pattern: Kubernetes Microservices

**Current**: Manual certificate Secret creation
**Target**: cert-manager with Keyfactor external issuer

**Migration Steps**:
```yaml
# 1. Create Certificate resource
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: api-cert
  namespace: production
spec:
  secretName: api-tls
  issuerRef:
    name: keyfactor-issuer
    kind: ClusterIssuer
  commonName: api.contoso.com
  dnsNames:
    - api.contoso.com

# 2. Apply and wait for issuance
kubectl apply -f certificate.yaml
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready certificate/api-cert -n production

# 3. Update Ingress or Pod to use new secret
# (cert-manager creates secret automatically)

# 4. Verify
kubectl describe certificate api-cert -n production
kubectl get secret api-tls -n production -o yaml
```

**Auto-Renewal**: ‚úÖ Automatic via cert-manager

---

### 5.4 Pattern: Azure App Service

**Current**: Manual PFX upload via portal
**Target**: Azure Key Vault integration with Keyfactor orchestrator

**Migration Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Keyfactor orchestrator deploys cert to Azure Key Vault (automatic)

# 2. Grant App Service access to Key Vault
az webapp config ssl bind \
  --certificate-source AzureKeyVault \
  --certificate-name api-contoso-com \
  --resource-group my-rg \
  --name my-app-service \
  --ssl-type SNI

# 3. Verify
az webapp config ssl list --resource-group my-rg --name my-app-service
```

**Auto-Renewal**: ‚úÖ Automatic via orchestrator

---

---

## 7. Rollback Procedures

### 7.1 Rollback Decision Criteria

**Trigger rollback if**:
- Production service unavailable for > 15 minutes
- Certificate validation failures across multiple services
- Keyfactor platform unavailable for > 2 hours
- Discovered security issue with new certificates

**Do NOT rollback for**:
- Single service issues (troubleshoot individually)
- Minor performance degradation
- Cosmetic or non-critical issues

### 7.2 Rollback Procedure

**Per-Application Rollback**:
```bash
# 1. Identify issue and document
# 2. Revert to old certificate configuration
#    - Restore old cert/key files
#    - Update service configuration
#    - Restart service

# 3. Verify service operational
# 4. Notify PKI team and stakeholders
# 5. Schedule troubleshooting and retry
```

**Platform-Wide Rollback** (emergency):
```
1. Stop all ongoing migrations immediately
2. Communicate to all teams: "Migration paused"
3. Revert recently migrated applications (last 24-48 hours)
4. Troubleshoot and resolve platform issue
5. Resume migration after issue resolved and tested
```
