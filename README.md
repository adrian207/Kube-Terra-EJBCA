## üí° Key Innovations

### 1. Multi-Layer Authorization (Defense in Depth)

Traditional PKI: "Are you authenticated?"  
**This design**: 4 independent authorization layers:

```
‚úì Layer 1: Identity RBAC (WHO can request)
‚úì Layer 2: SAN Validation (WHAT domains)
‚úì Layer 3: Resource Binding (WHERE can it be deployed)
‚úì Layer 4: Template Policy (HOW it's issued)
```

**Result**: Authorization failures provide actionable feedback ("You can't request *.prod.contoso.com because...") instead of generic denials.

---

### 2. Event-Driven Automation (Not Polling)

Traditional approach: Poll for expiring certs ‚Üí manually renew ‚Üí manually deploy

**This design**: Event-driven webhooks

```
Certificate expires in 30 days
  ‚Üí Keyfactor auto-renews
  ‚Üí Webhook fires: "certificate_renewed"
  ‚Üí Automation pipeline:
      1. Fetch new cert
      2. Update Key Vault / Vault
      3. Deploy to endpoint
      4. Reload service
      5. Verify
      6. Log to ITSM
  ‚Üí Zero manual intervention
```

---

### 3. Policy as Code (GitOps-Friendly)

Traditional PKI: Templates configured in CA GUI (click-ops)

**This design**: Templates defined in YAML/JSON, version-controlled

```yaml
template: TLS-Server-Internal
authorization:
  allowed_roles: [INFRA-ServerAdmins, APP-WebDevs]
  san_patterns: ["*.contoso.com"]
technical:
  key_algorithm: [RSA, ECDSA]
  lifetime_days: 730
approval: auto
```

**Result**: Infrastructure-as-code, auditable changes, easy to replicate across environments.

---

### 4. Secrets Separation (Zero Trust)

Traditional PKI: Certificates stored in central database

**This design**: Private keys NEVER leave secure enclaves

```
Option 1: Endpoint-generated keys
  - Client generates keypair
  - Submits CSR to Keyfactor
  - Keyfactor never sees private key
  
Option 2: HSM/Key Vault generation
  - Key generated in HSM
  - Signing operations via API
  - Key never exported
```

## üìä Success Metrics (KPIs)

| Metric | Current State | Target State | Timeline |
|--------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| **Auto-renewal rate** | ~20% | ‚â•95% | 6 months |
| **Cert-related outages** | 12/year | <1/year | 6 months |
| **Time to issue** | 2-5 days | <2 minutes | 3 months |
| **Certificate visibility** | ~60% | ‚â•98% | 3 months |

| **Policy compliance** | Unknown | 100% | 6 months |
| **Unmanaged certs** | Unknown | ‚â§1% | 6 months |

---

## üîí Security Highlights

### HSM Protection
- Issuing CA private keys: **FIPS 140-2 Level 3 HSM** (Azure Managed HSM or network HSM)
- Code signing keys: **HSM-only** (no export, API-based signing)
- Quorum-based access (3 of 5 key custodians)

### Audit & Compliance
- **All actions logged**: Issuance, renewal, revocation, denials, policy changes
- **Immutable logs**: 7-year retention, tamper-proof
- **SIEM integration**: Azure Sentinel / Splunk for security events
- **Quarterly access reviews**: Automated reports for compliance

### Separation of Duties
- **PKI Admin**: CA operations (no cert issuance)
- **Keyfactor Operator**: Platform config (no CA access)
- **Service Owner**: Request certs (only for owned services)
- **Security Auditor**: Read-only (no modifications)
